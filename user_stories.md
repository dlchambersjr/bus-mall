## Marketing Research Team
- As the Marketing Research Team, we want to identify which products are most likely to sell so that we can minimize product storage requirements and maximize potential revenue.
- As the Marketing Research Team, we want to present at least 25 groups of three products for individual members of a focus group to select a product, so we can determine which products are most popular.
- As the Marketing Research Team, we want to know both how many times a product was displayed and how many times that product was selected so we can compare each product equally on percentage.

## Focus Group Participant
- As a focus group participant, I want clear instructions, so I understand what is expected of me.
- As a focus group participant, I want to see the results of my effort, so I can feel good about my participation.
- As a focus group participant, I want an easy to use interface that is appealing to the activity I am participating in, so I wonâ€™t be confused on how to interact with the process.

## Developer
- As the developer, I want to have clear instructions as to what the user is expected to do, so they will easily and willingly complete the survey.
- As the developer, I want to create an area on the screen to display three products side-by-side, so the user knows where to look for each solution.
- As the developer, I will need to manage the size of the images so they will be as similar as possible so that one image will not appear favored over another.
- As the developer, I want to develop a randomizer that will select three different products, so they can be displayed to the user.
- As the developer, I want to track which products were actively displayed last, so the next three will not duplicate the previous three.
- As the developer, I want to track how many times each product is displayed and how many times it is selected, so I can provide statistical feedback that include the percentage a product was chosen.
- As the developer, I want to display the results in a clear and understandable fashion so they are easy to understand and interpret.
- As the developer, I want to select fonts and colors that are appropriate for the user interface, so the user will have an enjoyable visually enhanced experience.
